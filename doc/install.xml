The &Polenta; package is part of the standard distribution of &GAP; and
so normally there should be no need to install it separately.
If by any chance it is not part of your &GAP; distribution, then
the standard method is to unpack	 the package into the <C>pkg</C>
directory  of your &GAP; distribution.  This will create a <C>polenta</C>
subdirectory.
For other non-standard options please see
Chapter <Ref Chap="Installing a GAP Package" BookName="Reference"/>
of the &GAP; Reference Manual.
<P/>

Note that the GAP-Packages <Package>Alnuth</Package> and <Package>Polycyclic</Package>
are needed for this package.
Normally they should be contained in your distribution. If not,
they can be obtained at <URL>https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/packages.html</URL>.

Once the package is installed, it is possible to check the correct
installation by running the test suite of the package.

<Example><![CDATA[
    gap> ReadPackage( "Polenta", "tst/testall.g" );
]]></Example>

For more details on  Test Files see
Section <Ref Sect="Test Files" BookName="Reference"/> of the
&GAP; Reference Manual.
<P/>

If the test suite runs into an error, even though the packages
Polycyclic and Alnuth  and  their depdendencies
have been correctly installed, then please send a message
to <C>horn@mathematik.uni-kl.de</C> including the error message.
