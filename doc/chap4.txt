  [1X4.1 [33X[0;0YInstalling this package[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [5XPolenta[105X  package  is  part  of  the standard distribution of [5XGAP[105X and so
  normally  there should be no need to install it separately. If by any chance
  it  is  not  part  of  your [5XGAP[105X distribution, then the standard method is to
  unpack  the  package  into  the [10Xpkg[110X directory of your [5XGAP[105X distribution. This
  will  create  a  [10Xpolenta[110X subdirectory. For other non-standard options please
  see  Chapter  [14X'Reference:  Installing  a  GAP  Package'[114X of the [5XGAP[105X Reference
  Manual.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  the  GAP-Packages  [5XAlnuth[105X  and  [5XPolycyclic[105X  are  needed for this
  package.  Normally  they  should  be contained in your distribution. If not,
  they can be obtained at [7Xhttp://www.gap-system.org/Packages/packages.html[107X.[133X

  [33X[0;0YIf  the  [5XPolenta[105X  package  is not already loaded then you have to request it
  explicitly.  This  can  be done via the [2XLoadPackage[102X ([14XReference: LoadPackage[114X)
  command.[133X

  installation by running the test suite of the package.[133X
