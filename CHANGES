===========================================================================

1.3.10 (2022-03-29)
  - Updated Max Horn's contact details
  - Janitorial changes

1.3.9 (2019-10-01)
  - Janitorial changes

1.3.8 (2017-11-29)
  - Internal changes (use TestDirectory() to run tests in tst/testall.g)

1.3.7 (2016-11-09)
  - Disabled some unused code for multiplicative Jordan decomposition
    and for simultaneously diagonalizing commuting matrices
  - Avoid using polycyclic's NaturalHomomorphism operation, instead use
    NaturalHomomorphismByNormalSubgroup

1.3.6 (2016-03-08)
  - Internal changes (refactor ClosureBasePcgs_word, fix a URL)

1.3.5 (2016-02-14)
  - Fix a bug in IsomorphismPcpGroup for finite matrix groups

1.3.4 (2016-01-07)
  - Move website to http://gap-packages.github.io/recogbase/

1.3.3 (2014-11-28)
	o Fixed a bug in ExponentVector_AbelianSS which could lead
	  to IsomorphismPcpGroup running into an error.

1.3.2 (2014-04-01)
	o Moved the homepage
	o Updated Max Horn's contact details
	o Changed how the manual is built (now AutoDoc is used to
	  automatically generate the title page from PackageInfo.g)

1.3.1 (2012-06-01)
	o Fixed warning when loading without aclib
	o Some minor tweaks and cleanups

1.3 (2011-09-23)
	o Updated README
    o Added GPL license text
	o Added this CHANGES file
	o Fixed bug in POL_KroneckerProduct (used by the examples)
	o Added Max Horn as addition package maintainer; removed outdated
	  email address for Bjoern Assmann and removed his maintainer flag
	  (at least for the time being, due to lack of time on his part)
	o Removed references to KANT / KASH -- which is a dependency of
	  (old versions of) Alnuth, so we should not have to worry about
	  it here.
	o Fixed handling of matrix groups over finite fields that are
	  not prime fields.
	o Changed IsSolvableGroup method installation so that calling them
	  on matrix groups not defined over a field does not cause weird
	  errors anymore.
	o Changed the IsPolycyclicMatGroup methods to IsPolycyclicGroup
	  methods, so that more code can automatically benefit from this
	  functionality. The only remaining IsPolycyclicMatGroup method
	  simply invokes IsPolycyclicGroup. It will be removed in a future
	  version.
	o Converted documentation to GAPDoc format.
	o Turn IsTriangularizableMatGroup into a property.
	o Fixed bug that could cause an error while building an isomorphism
	  from a matrix group to a pcp group.
